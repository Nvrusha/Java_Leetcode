# Java_Leetcode 🧑‍💻

Welcome to my **Java_Leetcode** repository! 🎉 This repository contains my daily solutions to LeetCode problems written in Java. I am working through various algorithmic and data structure problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills. Each solution is fully commented, providing a detailed explanation of the logic, approach, and thought process behind each step. 💡

## About This Repository 📚

- **Daily Practice**:
  I solve LeetCode problems daily and commit my solutions to this repository. 📅
  
- **Clear Comments**:
 Every code file includes detailed comments explaining each line, making it easy for anyone to understand the logic and approach used in the solution. 📝
  
- **Organized by Problem**:
 Each problem is stored in its own folder, named after the problem or its number. 🗂️
  
## Repository Structure 🏗️
```plaintext
.
├── Problem-Name/
│   ├── README.md            # Problem description and approach.
│   └── Problem-Name.js      # Java solution code.
```

- Each problem has its own folder, named after the problem or its number. 🔢
- The folder contains:
  - A `README.md` file with the problem description, approach, and solution explanation. 📖
  - A Java file (e.g., `Problem-Name.java`) containing the code solution. 💻
